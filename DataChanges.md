Changes:
- a few had double strava segments
- Three had bad coords: 44, 61, 62
- a few had no strava segment
- stupid Hwy 21-245-180-198 California, doesn't have a strava route, but there's a longer one that can be used
- Tollhouse rd had the wrong rt, it's actually 9887218
- The Gibraltar rd segment has been flagged, so I used the Gibraltar TT segment(shorter), but on the actual route, it still does the longer version
- Fixed the lone pine to table mountain segment to a better one
